1. Apply for Live Access in Your Plaid Dashboard
You must apply for access to Plaid's Development environment. The Sandbox is a completely closed system with only fake data.

Action: Log in to your Plaid Dashboard, find the section to apply for API access, 
    and request to be moved to the "Development" environment. 
    You'll need to fill out a profile describing your project's use case 
    (e.g., "A personal tool to sync my own bank transactions").

2. Use New API Keys
Once your application is approved for the Development environment, 
    Plaid will issue you a new, separate set of API keys (Client ID and Secret).

Action: Replace the sandbox keys in your .env file with these new live keys.

3. Modify Your Authentication Code
Your current authentication script uses a Sandbox-only shortcut (create_sandbox_public_token). 
This will not work for a live bank. You must implement the standard Plaid Link authentication flow.

Action: You'll need to create a new script or modify your existing authenticate_plaid.py to follow these steps:

    1. Create a link_token: Your script will call Plaid's API to generate a link_token. 
        This token is used to initialize the Plaid Link UI.

    2. Open Plaid Link: Since your project is a script with no front-end, 
        the easiest way to complete this step is to construct a URL 
        (https://cdn.plaid.com/link/v2/stable/link.html?isWebview=true&token=YOUR_LINK_TOKEN_HERE) and 
        open it in your web browser.

    3. Log In: In the browser, you'll see the Plaid Link interface. 
        You will select your real bank and log in using your actual bank credentials. 
        Plaid handles this securely; your script never sees your credentials.

    4. Receive a public_token: After a successful login, the Plaid Link interface will display a temporary public_token.

    5. Exchange for access_token: You'll take this public_token and run your exchange_for_access_token function 
        to get your permanent, live access_token. You then save this new token to your access_token.txt file.
